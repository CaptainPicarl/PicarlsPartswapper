Picarl's Partswapper is a solo project of mine that I have decided to release the source code to, as I am transitioning to learning SE2 development.

This repository, and the project in general, contains three major projects:

1. PartSwapper XMLSE: This was the original, TUI-interface version of Partswapper.
2. PartSwapperGUI: This is the newer, WPF-based version of Partswapper
3. PartSwapperUnitTests: These are barely 'tests' in the traditional sense - but rather: Testing tools I made for myself to test loading, rendering, and certain operations.
Few of them have well-written assertions for them!

Some notes:
- This has been a solo project of mine for a couple years. I originally used this project to help me learn C# / WPF. Code conventions, naming schemes, and other schemes I came up with are probably bad. 
If you hate it: Make a PR.
- The structure is messy. I know. Once again: PR it if you hate it. Help me help...us!
- I'm happy to explain anything. Just please use Github Issues for questions / concerns. Discord messages might be fine, depending on the scale/scope.
- Signing key: You'll probably have to generate and sign the assembly with your own key. Disable this if you want - but i'm going to continue to sign with my key so folk know it's *my version*.
